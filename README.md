As part of my studies, I took part in a project with the following theme:

"Propose an innovation that makes the world a better place, that is useful and responds to an essential problem".

We chose to create a connected device capable of detecting vitamin deficiencies in the blood of pregnant women. All this to enable personalized monitoring and prevent problems during the pregnancy.

So I created a smartphone application that serves as an interface with the equipment which draws the blood.

It's a proof of concept, the application is an empty shell.
Here are the various visuals of the application, which can be installed on Android.
